## Introduction

'Les vacances amusantes de Omar' is a repo for a individual called **Omar Basfaou** to practice programming challenge during the summer.

## Extra Information
* All solutions **MUST** be written in Java and be able to run on my machine
* Absolutely **NO** AI help (Vibe coding is the worse thing since the holocaust)
* You can take **inspiration** from other solutions but all code must be written yourself and not copied.
* Most of the necessary documentation for the different puzzles are on this wiki
* You can only use the libraries I say you can use
* Your solutions will be publicly displayed in the repo (that means you gotta use git)

## Challenges
There are currently 5 challenges for Omar that will get progressively harder.
